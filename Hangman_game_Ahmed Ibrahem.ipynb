        "> ##### The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words.\n",
        "> ##### The Game: Here, a random word (a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to guess the fruit name correctly.\n",
        "> ##### When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible in the output.\n",
        "> ##### In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.\n",
        "> ##### For convenience, the number of chances equals the word length + 2.\n",
        "> ##### For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five letter word.\n",
        "> ##### Make game repeats until player ends the game.\n",
        "> ##### Bonus : Create a function that takes 3 parameters `Easy`, `Medium` and `Hard` where `Medium` has more difficult words to be guessed than `Easy` and so on."
